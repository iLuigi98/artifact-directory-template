Title:
Comparison of Differential Gene Expression Analysis Tools

Abstract:
RNA-Seq (named as an abbreviation of "RNA sequencing") is a technology-based sequencing technique which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment, analyzing the continuously changing cellular transcriptome. Differential expression analysis takes the normalized read count data and performs statistical analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups. As technology progresses by each year passing, there are now a lot of technological tools available in the Internet that can perform such differential expression analysis. The purpose of our project is to take a closer look at some of these tools, and compare their performances to understand which tools are optimal to utilize. Specifically, the softwares that we are going to focus on are: ABSSeq1, voom.limma2, PoissonSeq3, DESeq24, NOISeq5, ttest6  and edgeR7. We are going to compare their performances by looking at parameters such as Area Under the Curve (AOC), False Discovery Rate (FDR), Type I error rate, and Sensitivity.
