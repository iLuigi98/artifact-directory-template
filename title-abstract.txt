Title:
Comparison of Differential Gene Expression Analysis Tools

Abstract:
RNA-Seq (named as an abbreviation of "RNA sequencing") is a technology-based sequencing technique that uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment, analyzing the continuously changing cellular transcriptome. Differential expression analysis (DEA) takes the normalized read count data (number of sequence reads originated from a particular gene) and performs statistical analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups. As technologies keep progressing and improving, there are now multiple tools that can be used to carry out differential expression analysis. The purpose of our project is to take a closer look at some of these tools and compare their performance to understand which tools are optimal for DEA in different situations. Specifically, the software that we are going to focus on are: ABSSeq1, voom.limma2, PoissonSeq3, DESeq24, NOISeq5, ttest6 , and edgeR7. We will compare their performances by looking at parameters such as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), False Discovery Rate (FDR), Type I error rate, Sensitivity, and Specificity. In this project, we discovered that DESeq2 & edgeR performed similarly and were the overall best tools in most metrics and datasets. However, there were some circumstances in which other tools had advantages. When there were outliers with unusually high counts, both voom.limma & ttest performed significantly better, while ABSSeq showed benefits in controlling Type I errors when the number of truly differentially expressed genes was low. Overall, there was no single tool applicable in every situation. We could only identify each tool's strengths and weaknesses and showed circumstances where some tools were better over others.
